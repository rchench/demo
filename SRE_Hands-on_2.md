This is a hands-on project for an SRE interview.

Knowledge points which may be covered, but not limited to:

*   Virtualization and container technology
*   Ubuntu Linux administration and operation
*   Physical, Virtual, Container network management
*   Container administration and operation
*   Kuberenetes administration and operation
*   Git operation basis
*   Golang web programing basis

The purpose is to test if a candidate has the fundamental engineering skills/mindsets for an SRE position, or/and the self-learning abilities (quick, accurate, by just-do-it/show-me-the-code style) if the candidate is inexperienced in one or more areas.

It is also a mini working dry run for the candidate to experience and self-reflect if this is the right fit.

[[_TOC_]]

## Interview Approaches

There are two approaches to conduct this interview:

### **1.  Interview First**

Schedule the hands-on session first. Ask the candidate to complete "Task 0" as a prerequisite.

During the interview session (60 minutes), the candidate shall

*   share his/her computer's desktop for demonstration
*   complete as many tasks as possible to demonstrate the technical competence
*   feel free to reference any materials or search engines
*   ask questions or seek for help at any time

After the interview session, the candidate will have two calendar days to complete all the tasks, well document the procedure in a professional engineering way and send the deliverables to the hiring manager or recruiter.

### **2.  Project First**

Send all tasks to the candidate, who shall complete all tasks, well document the procedure in a professional engineering way and send the deliverables to the hiring manager or recruiter prior to the interview session. The days given to the candidate can be flexible, based on different background, experience and applied position.

During the interview session (60 minutes), the candidate shall

*   share his/her computer's desktop for demonstration
*   present his/her completion in the live environment (can ommit the time consuming part, e.g. reboot a machine)
*   answer any technical questions or perform additional ad-hoc tasks if being asked

After the interview session, if there is any follow-up action required, the candidate shall get back in the agreed time window.   

## **Task 0: Preparation for the Interview Environment**

The candidate shall prepare the following environment for the interview:

*   A Laptop or Desktop capable of running Virtualization and with an ssh client available to use. Any platforms (Windows, MacOS or Linux) are good.
*   A good internet connection capable of pulling system packages and application packages from the internet without significant delay.
*   A container registry account which can push and pull container images in a publicly accessible container registry
    * e.g. dockerHub account (free tier is ok), [https://hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com) 
*   Create a virtual machine (guest machine) on localhost (host machine) and install the latest **Ubuntu 22.04 server 64-bit** version.
    *   Can choose any hypervisor (virtualbox, vmware workstation/fusion, kvm, hyper-v, â€¦).
      *   Use virtualbox as a quick start for non-Apple silicons: [https://www.virtualbox.org/](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
      *   Windows Subsystem Linux (WSL 1 or 2) will not satisfy the requirement.
      *   Alternatively, you can also use any turn-key VM solution to spawn up a Ubuntu Linux, e.g. [multipass](https://multipass.run/), [orbstack](https://orbstack.dev/), so long as you can satisfy the requirement.
    *   4 x vCPUs and 8GB RAM preferred / 2 x vCPUs and 4GB RAM minimum
    *   Use either NAT or bridge network for VM network
    *   Ubuntu distribution: [http://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04/](http://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04/)
    *   sshd must be installed and enabled for ssh access
    
---

All the following tasks are to be performed in the ubuntu virtual machine, unless stated otherwise.

## **Task 1: Upgrade Operating System**

ssh to guest machine from host machine ($ ssh &lt;user>@localhost -p &lt;ssh port>).

_Since the VM network is NAT, what is the IP of the guest machine? And is it accessible from the host machine? What configuration is required in order to have ssh access?_

_What is NAT network? What is Bridge network? What are the differences?_

In ssh terminal (not the terminal provided by the hypervisor), upgrade the **Ubuntu system packages (packages re-installed in the system)** to the latest ([https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/package-management](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/package-management)).

Figure out what the **linux kernel version** is and then upgrade the kernel to the **latest LTS Enablement or Hardware Enablement (HWE) stack kernel **for 22.04 ([https://ubuntu.com/kernel/lifecycle](https://ubuntu.com/kernel/lifecycle) or [legacy](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack)).

## **Task 2: Install Docker Engine**

Install Docker Engine from Docker maintained repository (not Ubuntu maintained repository) [https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)

Run docker hello world to verify the installation.

_What are the relationships of the three components in Docker Engine, aka. docker-ce docker-ce-cli and containerd.io?_

## **Task 3: Install Gogs (a self-hosted git service)**

Install gogs from docker: [https://github.com/gogs/gogs/tree/main/docker](https://github.com/gogs/gogs/tree/main/docker) 

Choose the deployment configuration you prefer, just make sure it listens to port 3100 in the guest machine.

Expect output: Gogs is up and running at the guest machine, listening to port 3100. How to check if it is up and running as expected?

Open a browser in host machine and access gogs via [http://localhost:3100](http://localhost:3100)

_Is the port 3100 of the guest machine accessible from the host machine? If not, what configuration is required in order to expose it?_

For the first time, configure it following the installation steps 

*   Database uses SQLite3 (no external DB required)
*   Figure out the domain, ports and URL to be used
*   Create an admin user as well (username: root password: 123456)

## **Task 4: Create a Demo Organization/Repository in Gogs**

Sign in to gogs using admin account and create a demo org/repo named demo/go-web-hello-world (demo is organization name, go-web-hello-world is repository name)

Initiate the repo with a README.md and push the commit to master

Expected output: [http://localhost:3100/demo/go-web-hello-world](http://localhost:3100/demo/go-web-hello-world) 

## **Task 5: Install a Single Node Kubernetes Cluster Using Kind**

Follow instruction at [https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/).

Install kind first (use the stable binary rather than build from source to save time), then create a single node Kubernetes cluster using it.

Install kubectl client to interact with the cluster [https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/) 

Get cluster info, node info and list all pods in the cluster.

Check-in the kubeconfig file (~/.kube/config) into the gogs git repo. 

---

## **Task 6: Build and Run a Golang Web Application**

Use golang to build a hello world web app (listen to 8081 port) and check-in the code to the master branch of the repo created above

[https://golang.org/](https://golang.org/)

[https://gowebexamples.com/hello-world/](https://gowebexamples.com/hello-world/)

Expect source code at [http://localhost:3100/demo/go-web-hello-world](http://localhost:3100/demo/go-web-hello-world)

Expect output (from guest machine):
```
curl http://localhost:8081
Go Web Hello World!
```

## **Task 7: Run the App in Container**

Build a docker image ($ docker build) for the web app, tag it go-app:latest ($ docker tag) and run it in a container ($ docker run), expose the service to 8082 (-p)

[https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/)

Check in the Dockerfile into git repo

Expect output (from guest machine):
```
curl http://localhost:8082
Go Web Hello World!
```
What is the size of the container image? Can it be optimized? If yes, how? Can you please make it less than 10MB? Check in the optimized Dockerfile into git repo.

## **Task 8: Deploy the Hello World Container Image in Kubernetes**

Deploy the container image in the single node kubernetes created above and expose the service via nodePort 31080.

Figure out the node ip and access the service.

Expect output (from guest machine):
```
curl http://<node ip>:31080
Go Web Hello World!
```

Check in the deployment yaml file or the command line into the git repo

---

## **Task 9: Install Kubernetes Dashboard**

Install Kubernetes dashboard and expose the service to nodeport 31081

[https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/web-ui-dashboard/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/web-ui-dashboard/)

Can you access the dashboard URL via your host machine (not vm guest machine)? If not, how to configure the network to achieve it?

Open a browser in host machine and access the Dashboard via: [https://localhost:31081](https://localhost:31081) (asking for token).

Figure out how to generate a token to login to the dashboard.

Publish the procedure to the git repo.

---

## **Task 10: Build Gogs container image and push it to a container registry**

Document all technical procedures above in a README.md file, and check it in, together with all text files created above to the gogs git repo. Please make sure you properly use the Markdown syntax for a well formatted technical procedure, including but not limited to Titles, Sub-titles, Code Block, Link, List and etc.

Please do not write the procedure in Word or any document other than Markdown. Please do not attach any screen copies either.

Build a container image for gogs with your gogs config and demo/go-web-hello-world repo embedded. Please figure out how to persist your gogs config and repo in docker container ([https://docs.docker.com/storage/](https://docs.docker.com/storage/)) to avoid an empty gogs app requiring initiation. Please document the procedure for the image build/push in the README.md file as well.

- Tag the container image using your_dockerhub_id/gogs:v0.1 and push it to docker hub ([https://hub.docker.com/](https://hub.docker.com/))
- Create an overview file in your dockerhub repo for how to pull the image and start the gogs service to access your work in the gogs repo.
- Reference [https://hub.docker.com/r/gogs/gogs](https://hub.docker.com/r/gogs/gogs) 
- Expect output: [https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/your_dockerhub_id/gogs](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/your_dockerhub_id/gogs)

Expect that a single docker run command from consumer (assuming docker is available) can just bring up the gogs with all configurations/repo/files available.
```
docker run <parameters ... > <image:tag>
```

## **Task 99: Publish your work**

Please send the dockerhub repo or ARM docker repo link to the hiring manager or recruiter.
